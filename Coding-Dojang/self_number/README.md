# Self Number

## Introduction

Let's define d(n) as the sum of each digit in n and itself.

For example, 

    d(91) = 9 + 1 + 91 = 101

In this case, we say that 91 is a generator of 101 - in other words, n is a generator of d(n).

Some natural numbers have one or more generators - 100 is also a generator of 101.

On the contrary, there are natural numbers that don't have any generators. 
An Indian Mathematician Kaprekar named these numbers - self-numbers.

For example, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 20, 31 are all self-numbers.

## Problem

Create a function that calculates the sum of all self-numbers greater than or equal to 1 and less than 5000.
